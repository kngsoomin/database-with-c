# Database Management Program with C
#### Version 1.0 

[placeholder for gif]  

### üåÑ Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a database management program in C that is capable of:  
- [Separation of Data Structure and Data](#section-1)
- [SQL Syntax Parsing and Execution](#section-2)
- [Database Operations in a Doubly Linked List](#section-3)
- [Separation of Index and Data Structure](#section-4)
- [Separation of Linked List and UI Code](#section-5)
- [Distinction Between Data Stored in Files and Data Loaded in Memory](#section-6)
  
### üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Features
<h4 id="section-1"> 1. Separation of Concerns </h4>
[placeholder for image]<br/>
The <code>Node</code> structure handles the linked list functionality, while the <code>USERDATA</code> structure contains the actual data. This approach enhances modularity and makes the code easier to maintain.
<br/><br/>
<h4 id="section-2"> 2. SQL-Like Query Parsing </h4>
The system can parse and execute SQL-like queries. This allows for a familiar and intuitive interface for database operations.
<br/><br/>
<h4 id="section-3"> 3. Comprehensive Database Operations </h4>
Supported operations include:<br/>
<ul>
<li>SELECT</li>
<li>WHERE</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
<li>INSERT</li>
<li>ORDER BY</li>
</ul>

These operations are efficiently handled within the doubly linked list structure.
<br/><br/>
<h4 id="section-4"> 4. Optimized Index Management </h4>
The index field is separated from the main data structures. This design choice allows for:
<ul>
<li>Efficient range searches on integer fields</li>
<li>Avoiding the need to sort the entire data structure for searches</li>
<li>Generating and sorting an array of indices for optimized operations</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4 id="section-5"> 5. Modular Code Design </h4>
The codebase is organized with a clear separation between linked list operations and user interface code.
<br/><br/>
<h4 id="section-6"> 6. File vs Memory Data Management </h4>
The system operates primarily on in-memory data, but interacts with files in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Loads the initial database from a file into memory</li>
<li>Allows users to make changes to the in-memory database</li>
<li>Gives users the option to save their changes back to the file</li>
</ul>
